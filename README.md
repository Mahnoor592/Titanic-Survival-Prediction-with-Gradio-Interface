## Titanic-Survival-Prediction-with-Gradio-Interface

  This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic dataset using Machine   Learning models.  
It was implemented in Google Colab and deployed with a simple Gradio interface for user interaction.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, standardized data.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized survival trends by gender, age, and passenger class using Matplotlib/Seaborn.  
- **Encoding & Feature Engineering**: Applied label encoding and one-hot encoding for categorical features, created new features.  
- **ML Models**: Implemented and compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score were calculated.  
- **Gradio Interface**: Added an interactive UI for real-time survival prediction.  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Gradio
